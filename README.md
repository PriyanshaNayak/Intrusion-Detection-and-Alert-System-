# Intrusion-Detection-and-Alert-System-
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a monitoring system that detects suspicious activities and generates alerts when they are detected. Based upon these alerts, a security operations centre (SOC) analyst or incident responder can investigate the issue and take the appropriate actions to remediate the threat.
